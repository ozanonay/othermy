# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in OtherMy, please report it responsibly. We take security seriously and will work to address reported issues promptly.

**How to Report:**
- Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues
- Contact us through our website at https://othermy.com with details of the vulnerability
- Include steps to reproduce the issue if possible
- Allow reasonable time for us to address the issue before public disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will work with security researchers to address valid concerns.

## User Data Protection

OtherMy is committed to protecting user data:

- **Encryption**: Data is encrypted in transit using TLS and at rest using industry-standard encryption
- **Access Controls**: Strict access controls limit who can access user data
- **Regular Audits**: We conduct regular security audits and assessments
- **Incident Response**: We have procedures for responding to security incidents
- **User Control**: Users maintain control over their data and can request deletion

## Data Minimization

We collect and retain only the data necessary for platform functionality. Unnecessary data is not collected or is deleted when no longer needed.

## Third-Party Services

We use trusted third-party services for essential platform functions (such as cloud infrastructure and AI processing). These services are selected with security and privacy in mind, and we require strict confidentiality and security standards from our service providers.

## Limitations

While we implement strong security measures, no digital system is completely immune to security risks. We are transparent about our security practices and will notify affected users of any significant security incidents in accordance with applicable laws and best practices.

## Updates

This security policy may be updated to reflect changes in our practices or security requirements. Users will be notified of significant changes.
