# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is this real immortality?

No. OtherMy does not provide literal immortality or continuation of life after death. We create digital representations based on documented patterns of communication, thought, and experience. These representations are interactive models, not living beings. They can help preserve memory and facilitate meaningful interactions, but they are not the person themselves.

## Does OtherMy claim consciousness?

No. Our AI representations are sophisticated pattern-matching systems. They do not possess consciousness, sentience, or awareness. They respond based on training data and statistical models, not through understanding or feeling. We are explicit about this limitation and do not use language that suggests our AI is conscious or alive.

## What data is used?

OtherMy uses data that users explicitly provide, such as:
- Written conversations and messages
- Personal documents and writings
- Voice recordings (with consent)
- Photographs and videos (with consent)
- Responses to structured questions about preferences, experiences, and perspectives

We do not access private communications, emails, or other data without explicit user permission. Users control what information is included in their representation.

## Can users delete their data?

Yes. Users can delete their data and digital representation at any time during their lifetime. Deletion processes are designed to remove data from our systems, subject to reasonable technical constraints and legal requirements. For information about data retention policies and deletion procedures, please contact us through our website.

## Who controls access after death?

Users designate trusted guardians during their lifetime who can manage their digital representation after death. These guardians operate under clear guidelines and user-defined permissions. The system is designed to respect the wishes of the deceased as expressed through their account settings and guardian designations.

## Is this a medical or therapeutic tool?

No. OtherMy is not a medical device or therapeutic tool. It is a digital legacy and memory preservation platform. We do not claim therapeutic benefits, and we encourage users to seek appropriate professional support for grief, loss, or other psychological needs. Our platform is designed to support remembrance and connection, not to provide treatment or therapy.

## Is the product publicly available?

OtherMy is currently in active development. Availability varies by region and development phase. For current information about access, availability, and beta testing opportunities, please visit our website at https://othermy.com.

## How accurate are the AI representations?

AI representations are based on the data provided by users. Their accuracy depends on the quality and quantity of input data. Representations may capture patterns of communication style, preferences, and documented perspectives, but they are statistical models, not perfect replications. We encourage users to understand these representations as aids to memory rather than literal recreations.

## What happens if the company shuts down?

We are committed to providing clear data portability and archival options. Users can export their data, and we are working on long-term preservation strategies. Our commitment to user data control extends to scenarios where the platform may no longer operate.

## Is my data secure?

We implement industry-standard security measures including encryption in transit and at rest, secure authentication, and regular security audits. However, no digital system is completely immune to security risks. We are transparent about our security practices and will notify users of any significant security incidents affecting their data.

## Can I use this for someone who has already died?

OtherMy is primarily designed for individuals to create their own representations during their lifetime with full consent and control. Creating representations for deceased individuals raises complex ethical questions about consent and accuracy. If you are interested in this use case, please contact us to discuss ethical considerations and available options.

## How do you handle misinformation or harmful content?

Users are responsible for the content they provide. We have policies against harmful, illegal, or misleading content. If representations contain errors or problematic material, users (or their guardians) can modify or remove content. We do not actively monitor conversations or content, but we respond to reports of policy violations.

## Do you share data with third parties?

We do not sell user data. We may share data with trusted service providers necessary for platform operation (such as cloud storage or AI processing services) under strict confidentiality agreements. We are transparent about data sharing practices and provide users with control over their data.
