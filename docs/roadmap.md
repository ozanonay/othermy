# Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the major phases of OtherMy's development. Dates are intentionally omitted to avoid making promises we cannot keep. Development proceeds at a careful pace, prioritizing ethical considerations and user needs over speed.

## Phases

### Research & Framing

During this phase, we focus on:
- Ethical framework development
- Understanding user needs and concerns
- Research partnerships with ethicists and academics
- Technical feasibility studies
- Community engagement and feedback

This foundational work informs all subsequent development.

### Prototype

Prototype development includes:
- Core platform architecture
- Basic AI representation capabilities
- User interface and experience design
- Privacy and security infrastructure
- Guardian and posthumous access systems

Prototypes are tested internally and with close collaborators to validate concepts and identify issues.

### Private Testing

Before wider release, OtherMy undergoes private testing with:
- Careful selection of early users
- Structured feedback collection
- Ethical review of usage patterns
- Iterative improvements based on testing
- Documentation and support system development

Private testing helps ensure the platform is ready for broader availability while maintaining ethical standards.

### Public Release

Public release considerations include:
- Accessibility to broader user base
- Ongoing support and maintenance
- Continued ethical review and framework updates
- Community building and engagement
- Long-term sustainability planning

Public release timing depends on successful completion of earlier phases and confidence in ethical and technical readiness.

## Current Status

OtherMy is currently progressing through the Research & Framing and Prototype phases. Specific milestones and timelines are communicated to stakeholders through our website and direct engagement channels.

## Approach

Our roadmap prioritizes:
- Ethical considerations over speed
- User consent and control
- Transparency about limitations
- Careful, thoughtful development
- Long-term sustainability

We believe that digital legacy and AI representation require careful, deliberate development rather than rapid iteration.
