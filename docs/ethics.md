# Ethics and Principles

## Overview

OtherMy is built with the understanding that digital preservation of human identity raises complex ethical questions. This document outlines our ethical framework and commitments.

## Consent-First Design

Every aspect of OtherMy is designed to prioritize informed consent:

- Users create their own digital representation with full awareness of how it will be used
- No data is collected or processed without explicit user consent
- Users can modify or delete their representation at any time during their lifetime
- Clear, plain-language explanations of data use and AI processing

We recognize that consent is not a one-time event but an ongoing relationship with our users.

## Transparency About AI

OtherMy is transparent about what AI can and cannot do:

**What AI Represents:**
- Patterns of communication and expression captured from user-provided data
- Statistical models based on documented conversations, writings, and memories
- Interactive representations that respond based on training data

**What AI Is Not:**
- A conscious entity or sentient being
- A literal continuation of the person it represents
- A replacement for human relationships or genuine human connection

We explicitly do not claim that our AI representations are conscious, alive, or capable of actual thought or feeling. They are sophisticated pattern-matching systems designed to create meaningful interactions based on documented human expression.

## Privacy and Data Minimization

Our approach to data is guided by minimization principles:

- We collect only the data necessary to create the digital representation
- User data is stored securely with industry-standard encryption
- Users control what information is included in their representation
- Data retention policies are clearly defined and user-controlled

We do not sell user data or use it for purposes beyond the stated function of the platform. Users can request deletion of their data at any time, subject to reasonable technical constraints.

## Posthumous Access and Guardianship

One of the most sensitive aspects of digital legacy is posthumous access:

- Users designate trusted guardians who can manage their digital representation after death
- Clear, legally-informed processes for posthumous access
- Guardianship systems designed to respect the wishes of the deceased
- Transparent policies about what guardians can and cannot do

We recognize that posthumous digital presence raises questions about consent, control, and the wishes of the deceased. Our systems are designed to honor user-defined boundaries and provide clear governance structures.

## Grief-Aware Design

OtherMy is designed with awareness of the complex relationship between technology and grief:

**Healthy Engagement:**
- Tools that support remembrance and connection without creating dependency
- Clear boundaries between healthy memorialization and problematic attachment
- Recognition that digital representations are aids to memory, not replacements for the deceased

**Avoiding Manipulation:**
- No features designed to exploit emotional vulnerability
- Transparent about limitations and realistic about what the platform provides
- Support resources and guidance for healthy use

**Ethical Boundaries:**
- No claims that using the platform will reduce grief or provide closure
- Recognition that each person's relationship with loss is unique
- Design that respects the complexity of human mourning processes

We are committed to creating a platform that serves memory and connection without exploiting grief or creating unhealthy dependencies.

## Ongoing Ethical Review

Ethics in digital legacy is an evolving field. We commit to:

- Regular review of our ethical framework
- Engagement with ethicists, researchers, and community stakeholders
- Transparent communication about ethical challenges and decisions
- Adaptation of our practices as understanding evolves

This document is a living document that will be updated as we learn more about the ethical dimensions of digital preservation and AI-based representation.
